#Understanding REST

REST (Representational State Transfer) was introduced and defined in 2000 by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation. REST is an architectural style for designing distributed systems. It is not a standard but a set of constraints, such as being stateless, having a client/server relationship, and a uniform interface. REST is not strictly related to HTTP, but it is most commonly associated with it.

#Principles of REST

1) Resources expose easily understood directory structure URIs.
2) Representations transfer JSON or XML to represent data objects and attributes.
3) Messages use HTTP methods explicitly (for example, GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE).
4) Stateless interactions store no client context on the server between requests. State dependencies limit and restrict scalability. The client holds session state.
